- indexPage.html contains our HTML code, with shorts comments.
- First there comes navigation section with an example of how I would place some links in it and also I added three images by choice.
- There is a Light/Dark mode button that we can use to switch modes (of course, it changes the text, depending on the mode we are in).
- Then we have a rotating carousel section, but as much as I understood from the content page, it would have a title, a short description and register button.
I added two more different translated contents (all in Portugese, as in the example) to show how we can use here an animation for switching the contents.
I put one of the images as a background to bring some color :)
- After that, we have three-step section with animation that makes each step show up one after another, containing the titles and descriptions from the content file.
- Below them I added animated cards section that resembles the previous one, but here we have 3 cards which we can zoom on mouseover, which I found interesting 
for this section.
- Under the animated cards section, we have again the cta button, stylized the same as the one in the carousel section (I preffered it that way).
- And finally I added something by my choice, a footer with some images and additional animation that repeats, which makes sure each image shows up after the 
previous one is faded away, and fade away before the next one shows up. 

I used specific animation in CSS file (style.css) to gain all the effect mentioned above, also some parts needed to be handled by Javascript code in script.js file.
In the same js file I added Dark/Light mode change logic.
